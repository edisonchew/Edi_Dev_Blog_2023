                        <li>What is SQL?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SQL aka Structured Query Language is the core of the relational database which is used for accessing and managing the databases</li>
                            <li>The language is used to manipulate and retrieve data from a structured data format in the form of tables and holds relationships between those tables</li>
                            <li>Commonly SQL: MYSQL, MSSQL</li>
                            <li>One - One Relationship, One - Many Relationship, Many - Many Relationship, Self-Refencing Relationship</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>What is NoSQL?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>NoSQL, or commonly known as Not only SQL database, provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of unstructured data</li>
                            <li>This type of database can handle a humongous amount of data and has a dynamic schema</li>
                            <li>A NoSQL database has no specific query language, no or a very few relationships, but has data stored in the format of collections and documents</li>
                            <li>A database can have a 'n' number of collections and each collection can have 'm' number of documents</li>
                        </ul>
